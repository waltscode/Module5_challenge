# Module5_challenge- Intro

```
- Welcome to your new Daily Planner! The current date and time is present on the top of the screen and is easily visible for you! I added to the CSS stylings to make this element stand out.

- Below the date you will find an hourly table ranging from 9am-5pm. Each time-slot has the ability for the user to write down important memos corresponding to when they take place.

- When you click the 'save' button the information noted into the planner is saved for future use. When you reload the page the information entered will be readily available. 

- There is color coding associated with the time-slots. The times that are in the past are grey, the current hour slot you are in is colored red, and all future slots are colored green!

-Enjoy!
